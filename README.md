# identITy - Software Engineering

This project showcases a mobile app crafted with the **Flutter** framework and powered by **Firebase**, designed by a team of five. Our objective was not only to navigate the full software development lifecycle but also to construct scalable, maintainable, and robust software. Throughout this journey, we deepened our understanding of the Flutter framework, mastered the Dart language, and leveraged Firebase for our database needs. This collaborative effort was a comprehensive learning experience, aiming to excel in both technical skills and team dynamics.
